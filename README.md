The principal idea of this project is create a lego mindstorms  robot that can move in a omnidirectional way. The robot can go up/down right/left easily.

We think that an spider shaped robot is a good way to achieve this target.

We select [trotbot](https://www.diywalkers.com/mindstorms-trotbot-ver-3.html) version 3, to the best implementation.

But a more simple option is maybe an omnidirectional robot
